lua-weathermetrics
==================

Port of Brooke Anderson and Roger Peng's weathermetrics package to Lua.

You can find their original work at this URL:

<http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/weathermetrics/index.html>

From their package:

> Description: weathermetrics includes functions to calculate dew point
>         temperature, relative humidity, and heat index and to convert
>         between Celsius and Fahrenheit. All functions are based on
>         equations and algorithms used by the United States National
>         Weather Service.

This port to Lua employs the same MIT license as the original work.
